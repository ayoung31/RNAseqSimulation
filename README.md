# Simulate RNAseq Data for Multiple Studies

Tumor subtyping using RNAseq data is a well studied field with many clustering methods available. However, clustering results are not always consistent across studies. This repository simulates RNAseq data for a user specified number of clusters and studies.
The goal is to perform clustering on data from individual studies and on merged across studies, to see if existing methods can identify clusters that are common across studies.

Future work involves inducing heterogeneity of gene expression across studies and varying the number of true clusters across studies.
